# GCP Landing Zone Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

### Terraform Module Structure
1. **Organization Module** (`modules/organization/`)
   - Creates folder hierarchy (Shared Services, Prod, Non-Prod, Sandbox)
   - Sets organization-level policies (data residency, security baseline)
   - Configures billing and admin IAM

2. **Shared Services Module** (`modules/shared-services/`)
   - Creates all shared service projects following naming convention
   - Sets up Network Connectivity Center (NCC) hub
   - Deploys Shared VPCs in both regions (prod and non-prod)
   - Integrates security and logging modules

3. **Network Module** (`modules/network/`)
   - Creates VPC networks with global routing
   - Configures subnets with Private Google Access
   - Sets up NCC spoke connections
   - Implements firewall rules (hierarchical and VPC-level)
   - Creates Cloud DNS private zones

4. **Security Module** (`modules/security/`)
   - KMS keyrings and CMEK keys in both regions
   - VPC Service Controls perimeter configuration
   - Security Command Center setup
   - Hierarchical firewall policies
   - Binary Authorization (optional)

5. **Logging Module** (`modules/logging/`)
   - Log sinks for audit, platform, and application logs
   - Cloud Storage buckets with lifecycle management
   - Pub/Sub topic and subscription for Splunk export
   - BigQuery dataset for log analytics
   - Cloud Monitoring alerts and dashboards

## Key Design Decisions

### Naming Convention
- Production: `p-{bu}-{team}-{service}-{project_code}`
- Non-production: `np-{bu}-{team}-{service}-{project_code}`
- Example: `p-iss-cet-transit-glz001`

### Network Architecture
- Hub-and-spoke with Network Connectivity Center
- IP allocation from 10.245.0.0/17:
  - Prod ZA: 10.245.0.0/19
  - Prod LON: 10.245.32.0/19
  - Non-prod ZA: 10.245.64.0/19
  - Non-prod LON: 10.245.96.0/19
- **No direct internet access** - all traffic routes through on-premises
- Interconnect VLAN attachments configured in Terraform
- Private Google Access for GCP APIs only

### Security Controls
- CMEK encryption by default
- Single VPC Service Controls perimeter
- Hierarchical firewall policies
- Default deny-all with explicit allows

## Manual Steps Required

### Before Terraform
1. **Enable APIs** in an existing project:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com cloudbilling.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com
   ```

2. **Create Terraform state bucket**:
   ```bash
   gsutil mb -p [EXISTING_PROJECT] -l africa-south1 gs://thinkbank-terraform-state-glz001/
   gsutil versioning set on gs://thinkbank-terraform-state-glz001/
   ```

3. **Configure variables**:
   - Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`
   - Update with your organization details

### After Terraform
1. **Dedicated Interconnects**:
   - Order 2x 10Gbps interconnects in Johannesburg
   - Configure VLAN attachments
   - Set up BGP sessions

2. **Identity Setup**:
   - Install and configure Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS)
   - Set up Azure AD SAML federation with Cloud Identity

3. **Splunk Integration**:
   - Install Google Cloud Platform Add-on in Splunk
   - Configure Pub/Sub input with the created subscription

4. **Security Command Center**:
   - Enable Standard tier in Console (requires manual acceptance)
   - Review initial findings and configure notifications

5. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Update on-premises DNS with conditional forwarders
   - Test bidirectional resolution

## Deployment Process

1. **Use the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   This will guide you through prerequisites, planning, and applying.

2. **Or deploy manually**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Business Units**:
   - Create folders under appropriate environment folders
   - Use consistent project naming
   - Add projects to VPC Service Controls perimeter

2. **Configure Workload Projects**:
   - Use Shared VPC service projects
   - Apply appropriate IAM bindings
   - Enable required APIs

3. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Create custom dashboards
   - Configure additional alert policies
   - Set up SLOs for critical services

## Important Notes

- The Terraform service account created has broad permissions - secure the key carefully
- VPC Service Controls perimeter needs projects added manually as they're created
- Firewall rules are restrictive by default - test thoroughly
- Budget alerts are not configured - set these up based on your requirements

## Files Created

- `README.md` - Overview and module documentation
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- `deploy.sh` - Automated deployment script
- `modules/` - Reusable Terraform modules
- `outputs.tf` - Root module outputs with next steps
