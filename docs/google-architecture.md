## 3. Google Cloud Organization and Resource Hierarchy

A well-defined resource hierarchy is crucial for governance, cost management, and operational efficiency. The proposed structure, as detailed in [`gcp_new_spec.md:29-49`](gcp_new_spec.md:29-49), is as follows:

*   **Organization**: `bank.example` (Top-level node)
    *   **Responsibilities**: Represents the entire [Banking Group Name]'s Google Cloud presence. Manages organization-wide policies, billing, and IAM.

*   **Folders**: These provide an additional layer of isolation and policy inheritance.
    *   **`Folder: [Shared-Services-Folder-Name]`** (e.g., `00-Shared-Services`)
        *   **Responsibilities**: Hosts projects containing resources shared across the organization, such as networking, security tooling, logging, and monitoring. This promotes centralization and reusability.
        *   Key Projects:
            *   `Project: [Transit-Connectivity-Project-Name]`: For Global Network Connectivity Center (NCC) Hub and Cloud Routers.
            *   `Project: [Shared-VPC-Host-ZA-Project-Name]`: Hosts Shared VPC for `africa-south1`.
            *   `Project: [Shared-VPC-Host-LON-Project-Name]`: Hosts Shared VPC for `europe-west2` (DR).
            *   `Project: [Security-Tools-Project-Name]`: For Security Command Center, Policy Controller.
            *   `Project: [Logging-Project-Name]`: For centralized log sinks (e.g., to Pub/Sub for Splunk).
            *   `Project: [Monitoring-Project-Name]`: For centralized Cloud Monitoring resources.
    *   **`Folder: [Prod-Environments-Folder-Name]`** (e.g., `10-Prod-Environments`)
        *   **Responsibilities**: Contains all production workloads, segregated by business unit or team.
        *   Sub-Folders: `[BU-Team-Folder-Prod-Name]` (e.g., `bu-retail-prod`)
            *   Projects: `[Workload-Project-Name-Prod]`
    *   **`Folder: [Non-Prod-Environments-Folder-Name]`** (e.g., `20-Non-Prod-Environments`)
        *   **Responsibilities**: Houses development, testing, and UAT environments, also segregated by business unit/team.
        *   Sub-Folders: `[BU-Team-Folder-Dev-Name]`, `[BU-Team-Folder-UAT-Name]`
            *   Projects: `[Workload-Project-Name-Dev]`, `[Workload-Project-Name-UAT]`
    *   **`Folder: [Sandbox-Environments-Folder-Name]`** (e.g., `30-Sandbox-Environments`)
        *   **Responsibilities**: Provides isolated environments for experimentation and innovation, with potentially stricter controls on external connectivity and data access.

*   **Projects**: The fundamental unit for resource deployment, billing, and IAM.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Each project isolates resources for a specific application, environment, or service. They enable granular control over billing, APIs, and IAM permissions.

*   **Terraform for Resource Hierarchy Management**:
    *   The entire organization structure, including folders and projects, will be defined and managed using Terraform.
    *   Google provides Terraform resources like `google_organization_iam_member`, `google_folder`, `google_project`, etc., which will be used to codify this hierarchy.
    *   This ensures consistency, repeatability, and auditability of the organizational setup.
    *   A dedicated Terraform module catalogue (as mentioned in [`gcp_new_spec.md:143`](gcp_new_spec.md:143)) will define reusable components for creating and managing these resources.

---

## 4. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

A robust IAM strategy is central to securing cloud resources, as outlined in [`gcp_new_spec.md:53-60`](gcp_new_spec.md:53-60).

*   **Identity Source**:
    *   **On-prem Active Directory (AD)**: Remains the authoritative source for user identities.
    *   **Cloud Identity**: On-prem AD identities are synchronized to Cloud Identity using **Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS)**.
        *   **Responsibility**: Cloud Identity acts as the managed identity platform within GCP, enabling centralized user and group management. GCDS ensures identities are consistent between on-prem AD and GCP.

*   **Authentication**:
    *   **Azure AD**: Used for SAML 2.0 / OIDC federation.
        *   **Responsibility**: Azure AD provides Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies, integrating with Cloud Identity for authenticating users accessing GCP resources.

*   **Authorization**:
    *   **Group-based IAM Roles**: Permissions are assigned to Google Cloud groups (synced from AD).
    *   **IAM Conditions**: Provide fine-grained, attribute-based control over resource access.
    *   **Least Privilege**: The principle of granting only necessary permissions is strictly enforced.
        *   **Responsibility**: Ensures users and services have only the access required to perform their tasks, minimizing potential impact from compromised credentials or misconfigurations.

*   **Workload Identity Federation (WIF)**:
    *   Standard for non-human access (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, on-prem services accessing GCP APIs).
        *   **Responsibility**: Allows on-premises or multi-cloud workloads to impersonate Google Cloud service accounts without needing to manage service account keys, enhancing security. It leverages external identity providers (like Azure AD or on-prem IdPs) to grant short-lived credentials.

*   **VPC Service Controls Access Boundary**:
    *   A single, comprehensive perimeter protects critical Google Cloud services.
    *   Access is governed by context-aware policies (device compliance, user identity via AD groups).
        *   **Responsibility**: Prevents data exfiltration by restricting data movement from authorized GCP services to unauthorized locations, ensuring that sensitive data remains within the defined security perimeter.

*   **Managed Microsoft AD (MMAD)**:
    *   Deployment is deferred but can be optionally included if workloads require it ([`gcp_new_spec.md:57`](gcp_new_spec.md:57)).
        *   **Responsibility**: If deployed, MMAD would provide managed Active Directory services within GCP, primarily for AD-dependent workloads.

*   **Terraform for IAM Configuration**:
    *   IAM policies, roles, bindings, groups (if managed in GCP), and WIF configurations will be managed via Terraform (`google_project_iam_member`, `google_service_account_iam_member`, `google_iam_workload_identity_pool`, etc.).
    *   This ensures IAM settings are version-controlled, auditable, and consistently applied.

## 5. Networking and Connectivity

The networking architecture is designed for resilience, performance, and centralized control, detailed in [`gcp_new_spec.md:63-75`](gcp_new_spec.md:63-75).

### 5.1. Network Topology

*   **Hub-and-Spoke Model**: Utilizes a Global **Network Connectivity Center (NCC) Hub**.
    *   **NCC Hub**: Deployed in the `[Transit-Connectivity-Project-Name]`.
        *   **Responsibility**: Acts as a central point for managing connectivity between on-premises networks, Google Cloud VPCs, and other networks. It simplifies network management and provides global reachability.
*   **On-Prem Connectivity**:
    *   **Dual 10Gbps Dedicated Interconnects**: From Johannesburg co-location, connecting as VLAN attachments to the NCC Hub.
    *   **Cloud Routers**: Reside in the transit project for BGP route exchange with on-premises routers.
        *   **Responsibility**: Dedicated Interconnects provide high-bandwidth, low-latency, private connectivity between on-premises data centers and Google Cloud. Cloud Routers manage dynamic routing (BGP) to advertise and learn routes.
*   **GCP VPC Spokes**:
    *   Regional **Shared VPCs**:
        *   `[Shared-VPC-Host-ZA-Project-Name]` in `africa-south1` (Primary)
        *   `[Shared-VPC-Host-LON-Project-Name]` in `europe-west2` (DR)
    *   These are attached as spokes to the Global NCC Hub.
    *   Dynamic routing mode for Shared VPCs is **Global**.
        *   **Responsibility**: Shared VPCs allow service projects to use a centrally managed host project's network resources (subnets, firewalls). Global routing enables resources in different regions to communicate privately using Google's backbone.

### 5.2. IP Addressing & BGP

*   **GCP Address Range**: `10.245.0.0/17` (advertised to on-prem).
*   **On-Prem Address Ranges**: Standard RFC1918 (advertised to GCP).
*   **Cloud Router ASN**: `[YOUR_PRIVATE_ASN]` (to be provided).
    *   **Responsibility**: Ensures unique and non-overlapping IP address spaces for proper routing. BGP exchanges route information dynamically.

### 5.3. Internet Egress

*   All internet-bound traffic from GCP services is routed via the Interconnects to the on-premises network and egresses through corporate internet breakout points.
*   No direct internet breakout from GCP.
    *   **Responsibility**: Centralizes internet security inspection and policy enforcement at on-premises security gateways, aligning with traditional enterprise security postures.

### 5.4. Access to Google APIs

*   **Private Google Access**: Configured for subnets using `restricted.googleapis.com`.
    *   **Responsibility**: Allows GCP resources with internal IP addresses to access Google APIs and services without traversing the public internet, enhancing security and reducing egress costs. `restricted.googleapis.com` further limits access to services supported by VPC Service Controls.

### 5.5. Firewall Architecture

*   **Hierarchical Firewall Policies**: Applied at Organization/Folder levels.
*   **VPC Firewall Rules**: Applied at the VPC network level.
*   Default deny-all egress from VPCs.
*   Tag-based rules for allowed intra-VPC and VPC-to-on-prem traffic.
    *   **Responsibility**: Provides layered security. Hierarchical firewalls enforce baseline policies, while VPC firewalls provide more granular control. Default-deny ensures only explicitly allowed traffic flows. Tags simplify rule management for dynamic environments.

### 5.6. DNS Architecture

Described in [`gcp_new_spec.md:78-85`](gcp_new_spec.md:78-85), ensuring seamless name resolution across environments.

*   **Split-Horizon DNS**: Different DNS views for internal and external resolution.
*   **GCP Private Zones**: Cloud DNS private zones (e.g., `gcp.bank.example`) associated with regional Shared VPCs.
    *   **Responsibility**: Provides authoritative name resolution for GCP resources within the VPCs.
*   **On-Prem to GCP Resolution**: On-prem BIND servers use conditional forwarding (via Cloud DNS inbound server policies in Shared VPCs).
    *   **Responsibility**: Allows on-prem clients to resolve GCP private DNS names.
*   **GCP to On-Prem Resolution**: Cloud DNS outbound server policies/forwarding zones in Shared VPCs point to on-prem BIND servers.
    *   **Responsibility**: Allows GCP resources to resolve on-prem DNS names.
*   **Public DNS**: Managed via Cloud DNS public zones (e.g., for `bank.example`).
    *   **Responsibility**: Manages the bank's public-facing DNS records.

### 5.7. Terraform for Network Configuration

*   All networking components—NCC Hub, VPCs, subnets, interconnect attachments, Cloud Routers, firewall rules, DNS zones, and policies—will be defined and managed using Terraform.
*   Google Cloud provider offers resources like `google_compute_network`, `google_compute_subnetwork`, `google_compute_router`, `google_compute_firewall`, `google_dns_managed_zone`, `google_network_connectivity_hub`, `google_network_connectivity_spoke`.
*   This ensures the network infrastructure is version-controlled, auditable, and can be consistently replicated across environments (e.g., for DR).

    *   **Responsibility**: Provides centralized visibility into security posture, identifies misconfigurations, threats, and compliance violations across the GCP organization. Integrates with services like Security Health Analytics, Event Threat Detection.

### 6.4. Policy Enforcement

*   **Policy Controller (Anthos Config Management)**: For policy-as-code.
    *   **Responsibility**: Enables the definition, enforcement, and monitoring of custom policies (using Open Policy Agent - OPA) across Kubernetes clusters and, increasingly, GCP resources. This ensures configurations adhere to organizational standards and compliance requirements.

### 6.5. Logging & SIEM Integration

*   **Cloud Logging**: Exports all critical audit, platform, and application logs via **Pub/Sub** to on-prem **Splunk**.
    *   **Responsibility**: Cloud Logging provides centralized log collection from GCP services. Pub/Sub acts as a scalable and reliable messaging queue to buffer and stream logs to the on-premises Splunk SIEM for long-term retention, analysis, and incident response.

### 6.6. Terraform for Security Configuration

*   Terraform will be used to configure:
    *   Cloud KMS keys and IAM policies (`google_kms_key_ring`, `google_kms_crypto_key`).
    *   VPC Service Control perimeters and access levels (`google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter`, `google_access_context_manager_access_level`).
    *   Security Command Center settings (where applicable via API/gcloud invoked by Terraform).
    *   Policy Controller configurations and constraints.
